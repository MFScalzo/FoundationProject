### Project Description
A Python CLI (Command Line Interface) application.  Data should be parsed from a CSV OR JSON file and persisted to MongoDB.

- Your application must be able to read JSON or CSV files, and store the data contained within those files in a database
- Your application should have a CLI where users can interact with the application while it is running
- Other than those requirements, the kind of application you have is up to you.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
  - File I/O
  - Collections
- Visual Studio Code
- MongoDB
- PyMongo
- git SCM (+ GitHub)

## Presentation
- 5 minute live demo.  Present the application, not the code.

## Due Date
- Project will be presented Friday of Week 5 (April 1).

Finishing your MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as early as possible before iterating new features upon the project is highly recommended.  Plan ahead, and be sure to reach out to others when you need guidance (or offer your own to those in need).  You are *REQUIRED* to be able to explain your project functionality and write your own code, but feel free to have in-depth discussions with others.
